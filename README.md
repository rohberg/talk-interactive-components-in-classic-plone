# Interactive Components in Classic Plone with Svelte

Talk at Plone Conference 2020

Enhance your classic Plone site with an eycatching UX. Compents like person search, data visualization or map search are written in Svelte with just a few lines. And you know: few lines, few bugs. Embedding the component in a Plone browser view is quite easily done by adding some html and including the compiled code.
